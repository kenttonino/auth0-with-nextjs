      files, and data a user has access to.


Auth0
-----
  - A user authentication and authorization platform that
    serves as the front door for an application.

  Before you can use your app securely:
    - We need to prove their identity.
      - Common way, email password authentication.
        - Requires an interface from the frontend to collect
          the password then pass it to a server and database
          to store it on the backend for future use.
        - Your frontend needs to looks good and backend needs
          to become secured and reliable.
  
  - Auth0 is a universal solution that can handle the process
    above.
